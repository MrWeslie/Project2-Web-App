# Project2-Web-App

An online claim submission form made using the different CRUD METHODS- CREATE, READ, UPDATE AND DELETE. This is ran using node.js, with PSQL as the database. 

This web app enables user to either submit a new claim form, or to edit and delete on a previous claim. The app will verify to see if the the user is eligible for the claim he had submitted. For instance, whether the user had over-claimed or submitted a claim he is not entitled for.
